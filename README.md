# [24SPY](https://tiaguinho2009.github.io/24SPY/)

**24SPY** is a developing platform designed to display real-time information about aircraft and ATC controllers currently online on the ATC24 server, similar to VATSIM Radar. This project serves both as a functional tool and a way to enhance my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills while contributing to the virtual aviation community.

## [DEV 0.2] - 25/02/2025
### Added
- New SIDs/STARs System! (Only works for IRFD for now...) (They are complety optional, if don't want to use it you don't need.)
- New option called "Show a Higher Quality Map", when ur zoom is > 10 it will render a 14Kx14K image of the map for better view. (This already was working in the past but now u can turn it on or off so ur screen does not freezes for 5 seconds loading the image).
- Now the zoom its animated (or smoother).
- The Back-End server of 24SPY is Online again!!!
- New function for the "Show Navaids Labels" option, before it only worked for global rendering, now it also works in FPL.
- New small system that detects when a new update is released while with the website open.

### Corrected
- Bug of zooming in and back out leaves you at a different spot than before fixed.
- Bug of cursor leaving the map does not stop map moving fixed.
- IGAR RWYs not working fixed.
- IPPH RWYs HDGs fixed.
- IZOL RWYs and HDGs fixed.
- IBTH RWYs corrected.
- IRFD RWYs corrected.
- Some fixes Names corrected.
- Code of the Flight Plans and AirportUI was rewrited. (No visual changes)
- And a LOT of other bugs that i don't remember were fixed.
